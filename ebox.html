    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>What does E-box do?</h3>
    <p>Being organized is one of the most important key factors to become successful in just about anything you do. Being able to organize anything, anywhere is maybe a superpower? being able to upload, organize share personal files online and
      offline? Yes, please! That's why I was eager and passionate about the process of design along with the development of creating an online storage service.</p>
    <h3>Problem</h3>
    <p>In a highly saturated market already with great usability and experience with organization and collaboration, how might we design a storage system with an emphasis on organization and collaboration that is easy for users to store and showcase
      content? </p>
    <h3>Solution</h3>
    <p>Bringing in a new perspective. E-box has the fun flexibility of document storage, content creation, visual organization tools, powerful searchability and real-time collaboration available within one intuitive interface. </p>

    <h2>Discovery Phase</h2>
    <h3>User Research</h3>
    <p>To understand what the audience needs, I created a user research survey focused on how people browsed the internet and saved content, why users used the services that they used and common likes and dislike about the current services
      they use. </p>
    <p>why users used the services that they used and common likes and dislikes about the current services they use.
      Features do you use the most?
      What are some frustrations you have experienced?</p>
    <p>I summarized the data and it revealed that users were still having some frustrations from organizing to saving content. Why would big name brand services still have frustrations with their services? This is an opportunity where I can create
      solutions for users who still have frustrations providing a better experience for users. </p>
    <h2>User Personas</h2>

    <article class="biography">
      <strong>Biography:</strong>
      <p>Jerry grew up fishing most of his childhood, to this day he finds peace of hearing the sounds of wildlife and running waters. He doesn’t go as often anymore since he now has a newborn child to raise and a lovely wife to take
        care of. He says when his newborn is old enough to walk, he will take him fishing at his favorite spot.</p>
      <strong>Goals: </strong>
      <p> - To quickly categorize content for searches
        - Multiple creations and uploading tools on all devices

    <h3> User Stories and Flows</h3>
    <p>With previous research in mind, one of the easiest ways to start the design of the smoothest paths for adding content, searching for specific items, and managing accounts. All the while having an MVP. </p>

      <h2>Paper and Wireframes</h2>
      <p>After sketching a few iterations from the user flow, I started to wireframe in Figma. The wireframes were used to create a clickable prototype to test the usability of my ideas for feasibility. </p>

      <h2>User Testing </h2>
      <p>When undergoing functionality testing of the low-fi prototype, specifically testing the flow of Onboarding, Uploading, Sharing and Creating. Feedback collected from testers informed me to adjust the following…</p>
      <p>-Add functionality to all buttons
        -File and share toolbar not needed
        -Buttons to big/ change to icons
        -Move profile to top right
        -Input icons instead of big buttons</p>
      <p>After going through feedback collected from testing and a few iterations later, here is what it looks like. The goal was always keeping a simple homepage that was easily navigatable. Along with a modern and humanistic feel. Taking a look at
        the refined wireframe I added all suggestions from users, such as implementing icons instead of big buttons, with a drop-down button to utilize whitespace. Added a consistent look overall with icon choices, color choice, and layout.</p>

      <h2>Preference Testing</h2>
      <p>To confirm and lock in my design decisions, I took it through a basic A/B test. Making sure the layout is suitable for users.
        After testing, the result was users liked the original design best.</p>

    <h2> Brand & Identity </h2>
    <h3> Branding Work </h3>
    <p>Developing the concept for the brand began with sketching and mind mapping. This process just keeps ideas to be visual on paper, snowballing for more ideas.
      For storage, I kept thinking of boxes as they are always used to hold or store items. Being an online service, I really kept it simple by adding an E for electronic box or E-box for short. </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <h3>What I learned </h3>
    <p>Developing e-box has given me valuable insight into the phycology behind effortlessly organizing files for users all over. If given more time, further refinements would be added to user testing and wireframes. This would allow me to
      attain data critical to the experience improvement for users; as well as designing a visually appealing layout. Going into the project I saw no reason to research, test, map, etc. thinking “if I like my design and it works for me why should I
      change it?” In the end, the design process is the greatest tool a designer has. Following the process not only helps me as a designer but also the design solution that came out of it to create a better user experience. I find the process not
      restricting but channels your ideas out visually with convenient steps to ensure you have everything need.</p>
