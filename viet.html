        <h3>What does vietspc.org do?</h3>
        <p>This website allows you to stay centralized on updating information during your time volunteering in your assigned city. Learn about the weather and sample door presentations in your language. (English / Vietnamese). As an official website made available for Vietnamese preachers all around the U.S, I was focused on creating the best UX design I had ever done!</p>

            <p class="testbox">We had just about 4 weeks to launch a responsive website with content containing videos and pictures related to the Vietnamese Campaign that would be available in both Vietnamese and English translations. </p>

        <h3>User Research</h3>
        <p>With little time to conduct user surveys determining how people used preaching websites, we conducted a few user interviews obtaining an interest in requirements the stakeholders already wanted the website to entail. This made sure the features the stakeholder wanted were also something users would find an interest and enjoy.</p>

        <p>From the SUS test analysis on a scale of 1-5 of most interested in possible features such as weather, purpose/goal statement, picture gallery, time/location of meetings, sample presentations were all rated high in interest. This informed us the keep along with all features and continue on with the process. </p>

        <h3>User Testing </h3>
        <p>When undergoing functionality testing of the low-fi prototype, testing the flow of the site. Feedback collected from testers showed no problems navigating the site. However there were a few modifications to be made. </p>
        <p>-Add functionality to all buttons<br>
          -Input videos for homepage and pictures for about city page<br>
          -Follow-up and Experience tabs takes you to google forms, instead of seperate page<br>
          -Instead of buttons for locations and times, already have it showing on the page<br>
          -Make icons larger and clearer to read on mobile devices</p>
        <p>After going through feedback collected from testing and a few iterations later, here is what it looks like. The goal was always keeping a simple homepage that was easily navigatable for people of all ages. Presenting information in a way for users to easily learn on the go.</p>

        <p>To confirm and lock in my design decisions, I took it through a basic A/B test. Making sure the layout is suitable for users.
          After testing, the result was users liked the original white/grey background design best.</p>

        <h2 class="heading">Conclusion</h2>
        <h3>What I learned </h3>
        <p>I was very eager to start this project since this would be my official live project on a team. We wanted Vietspc.org to be simple, stylish and effective!
          Communicating together and brainstorming ideas was how we began this process. I am glad to say we are happy with the end product. By working with well-experienced designers,
          I learned so much more about UX design throughout the entirety of the project and how fast pace things can go. One minute you’re working on functions for a prototype and the next minute all the functions added are to be replaced with new ones.
          With all the quick iterations, it’s easy to forget the goal of designing. I believe the best goal to always have in mind is "Better User Experience!" at the end of the day isn’t that all that matters?</p>
