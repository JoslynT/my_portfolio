        <h3>What does vietspc.org do?</h3>
        <p>This website allows you to stay centralized on updating information during your time volunteering in your assigned city. Learn about the weather and sample door presentations in your language. (English / Vietnamese). As an official website made available for Vietnamese preachers all around the U.S, I was focused on creating the best UX design I had ever done!</p>

        <h3>User Research</h3>
        <p>With little time to conduct user surveys determining how people used preaching websites, we conducted a few user interviews obtaining an interest in requirements the stakeholders already wanted the website to entail. This made sure the features the stakeholder wanted were also something users would find an interest and enjoy.</p>

This informed us the keep along with all features and continue on with the process. </p>

        <strong class="padding">Biography</strong>
        <p>Jerry grew up fishing most of his childhood, to this day he finds peace of hearing the sounds of wildlife and running waters. He doesn’t go as often anymore since he now has a newborn child to raise and a lovely wife to take
          care of. He says when his newborn is old enough to walk, he will take him fishing at his favorite spot.</p>
        <strong class="padding">Goals </strong>
        <p> - To quickly categorize content for searches<br>
          - Multiple creations and uploading tools on all devices<br>
          - Quickly and easily add files on multiple platforms</p>
        <strong class="padding">Frustrations</strong>
        <p>- Features missing on some devices<br>
          - Process of editing documents on mobile<br>
          - Confusing file sharing and uploading without an account </p>
        <strong class="padding"> Motivations</strong>
        <p>Jerry currently uses multiple storage platforms to store his personal and work-related files. He needs to create and access his files on his devices as he always needs to access his files where ever he is. Jerry is a very organized
          individual and needs all his files to be the same. Sometimes frustration occurs with the process of searching for his files.</p>

        <strong class="padding">Biography</strong>
        <p>Fiona’s dream is to travel the world. In the meantime, while she attends her state college for a degree in culinary, she takes her of her 3 kittens. Her life is busy as it gets for a student. Waking up early to prepare for the day,
          attending
          her classes and studying at night. To support herself she creates cooking tutorials on social media.</p>
        <strong class="padding">Goals </strong>
        <p>- To easily share and view groups of images and files<br>
          - Automatic file tags or suggestions<br>
          - Smoother uploading speed associated with larger files </p>
        <strong class="padding">Frustrations</strong>
        <p> - Confusing to integrate stored content with social media<br>
          - Time consuming to organize files<br>
          - Glitches when uploading bigger files </p>
        <strong class="padding"> Motivations</strong>
        <p> Fiona has many recipes to try to memorize, originally everything was written down. Now she has her files on the cloud, which makes her life easier because she can simply open her tablet in the kitchen and start cooking instead of walking
          every looking for her papers. She is always on the look for new recipes and when she finds one online she likes to save the link to the cloud. </p>

        <h3>User Testing </h3>
        <p>When undergoing functionality testing of the low-fi prototype, specifically testing the flow of Onboarding, Uploading, Sharing and Creating. Feedback collected from testers informed me to adjust the following…</p>
        <p>-Add functionality to all buttons<br>
          -File and share toolbar not needed<br>
          -Buttons to big/ change to icons<br>
          -Move profile to top right<br>
          -Input icons instead of big buttons</p>
        <p>After going through feedback collected from testing and a few iterations later, here is what it looks like. The goal was always keeping a simple homepage that was easily navigatable. Along with a modern and humanistic feel. Taking a look
          at
          the refined wireframe I added all suggestions from users, such as implementing icons instead of big buttons, with a drop-down button to utilize whitespace. Added a consistent look overall with icon choices, color choice, and layout.</p>

        <h3>What I learned </h3>
        <p>I was very eager to start this project since this would be my official live project on a team. We wanted Vietspc.org to be simple, stylish and effective!
          Communicating together and brainstorming ideas was how we began this process. I am glad to say we are happy with the end product. By working with well-experienced designers,
          I learned so much more about UX design throughout the entirety of the project and how fast pace things can go. One minute you’re working on functions for prototype and the next minute all the functions added are to be replaced with new ones.
          With all the quick iterations, it’s easy to forget the goal of designing. That goal is better User experience, at the end of the day isn’t that all that matters?</p>
